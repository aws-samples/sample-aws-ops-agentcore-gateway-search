# Static Assets

This folder contains static assets for the project documentation:

- **Architecture Diagrams**: PNG images showing the multi-agent system architecture
- **Demo GIFs**: Animated demonstrations of the Streamlit UI in action
- **Screenshots**: Additional visual assets as needed

## Expected Files

- `architecture_diagram.png` - System architecture showing all 6 agents and supporting services
- `multi_agent_demo.gif` - UI demonstration showing agent interaction and features

## Guidelines

- Use PNG format for diagrams (1200-1600px width recommended)
- Keep GIF file sizes under 10MB
- Use descriptive filenames
- All assets should be referenced in the main README.md using relative paths
